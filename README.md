## Overview
This project involves creating a Tableau dashboard to visualize Netflix data. The dataset used contains information about Netflix shows, including titles, genres, release dates, and more. The goal is to gain insights into the distribution of shows across genres, analyze trends over time, and provide a comprehensive view of the Netflix content landscape.

### 3. Regional Analysis
A map-based visualization indicating the geographical distribution of shows. This can help in understanding regional preferences and content availability.

### 4. Top Rated Shows
A bar chart or table displaying the top-rated shows based on user ratings. This allows users to quickly identify highly recommended content.
